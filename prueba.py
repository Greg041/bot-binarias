click on the center of an image with a bit of random.
eg, if an image is 100*100 with an offset of 5 it may click at 52,50 the first time and then 55,53 etc

image : path to the image file (see opencv imread for supported types)
pos : array containing the position of the top left corner of the image [x,y]
action : button of the mouse to activate : "left" "right" "middle", see pyautogui.click documentation for more info
